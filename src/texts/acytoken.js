## ACY contract address: Coming Soon

ACY’s core contributors are a group of talented youth from Tsinghua University and Stanford University. Core team is equipped with entrepreneurial experience, blockchain industry experience, quantitative finance, stock market background and experience, and hard-core technical abilities. 

It is precisely because of the core contributors’ past experiences and expertise that allowed us to combine technically sound solutions with ones that make financial sense at a fundamental level. Since its inception, the ACY Protocol has served as trustless and highly decentralized financial infrastructure.

ACY has long committed to the ideals of permissionless access, security, and immutability, all indispensable components for a future where anyone in the world can access financial services without fear of discrimination or counterparty risk. Now rivaling centralized incumbents on daily volume, ACY devotes to meet the demand for permissionless financial services.

What is more ACY is an anti-robot decentralized exchange. For the first time in the history, investors are able to out-maneuver arbitrage bots and reclaim value previously lost to MEV. In the past, MEV bots were invincible. In this new world created by ACY, investors will now have the upper hand. 

ACY&apos;s swap transaction is different from any other transactions. When user do swap on ACY, the smart contract will automatically do an arbitrage for the swap, and the benefits will goes to the users and LPs. All of these in one single transaction. This means that any other arbitrage transactions after our swap transaction will have no more arbitrage opportunity.

Having proven product-market fit for highly decentralized financial infrastructure with a platform that has thrived independently, ACY is particularly well positioned for community-led growth, development, and self-sustainability. 

The introduction of ACY (ERC-20) serves this purpose, enabling shared community ownership and a vibrant, diverse, and dedicated governance system, which will actively guide the protocol towards the future.

ACY has always embraced the tenets of neutrality and trust minimization : it is crucial that governance is constrained to where it is strictly necessary. With this in mind, the ACY governance framework is limited to contributing to both protocol development and usage as well as development of the broader ACY ecosystem.

In doing so, ACY officially enshrines ACY as publicly-owned and self-sustainable infrastructure while continuing to carefully protect its indestructible and autonomous qualities.
