## What are cookies and how are they used?

Cookies are text files, containing small amounts of information, which are downloaded to your browsing device (such as a computer or smartphone) when you visit a website. Cookies can be recognised by the website that downloaded them — or other websites that use the same cookies. This helps websites know if the browsing device has visited them before.

 

Cookies can help us recognize your browser and link your account with it, should there be a registered account under your name. With cookies, we can understand how our website is being used, compile data about site traffic and interaction for further improvement, and remember your preferences to let you navigate between pages efficiently, generally improving your browsing experience.

## What is your cookie retention policy?

The length of time a cookie will stay on your browsing device depends on whether it is a “persistent” or “session” cookie. Session cookies will only stay on your device until you stop browsing. Persistent cookies stay on your browsing device after you have finished browsing until they expire or are deleted.

注：我们的cookie有没有具体时限？如果有的话，需要改一下这段。有的网站是保留server log 最多90天。
