Exchanges allow investors to buy and sell cryptocurrencies and crypto assets for fiat currencies and other currencies. Exchanges play an essential role in the cryptocurrency economy, we divided them into two groups- centralized and decentralized exchanges. A distinct difference between these types of exchanges is the presence of the third party service where the investment vehicle holds the customerâ€™s funds.`,

This industry is divided into two parts: platforms that allow users to create and manage funds and professionally-managed crypto funds. Most of these services manage funds only inside the crypto universe.
